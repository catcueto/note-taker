# Note-Taker

The note-taker application can be used to write, save, and delete notes as necessary. This could be a powerful tool to help users stay organized and on track of those tasks we easily forget when they are not written down somewhere.

## Technologies

The application was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js (specifically Express). On the server-side, a JSON database is utilized to keep track of new inputs and deleted notes.

## Installation

To install, run nodemon server.js in the command line. Then, an http://localhost URL will be displayed on the terminal. Copy and paste it on the your browser of choice to access the application.
